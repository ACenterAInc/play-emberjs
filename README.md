# Ember.js Plugin

This plugin provides build time compilation for [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) handlebar templates.

# How to install

* play 2.2.x

```
addSbtPlugin("com.ketalo.play.plugins" % "emberjs" % "1.4.0-SNAPSHOT")
```

You may need to add a reference to the Sonatype repository
```
resolvers += "Sonatype snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2"
```

Or for snapshots

```
resolvers += "Sonatype snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
```

* play 2.1.x:

```
addSbtPlugin("com.ketalo.play.plugins" % "emberjs" % "1.4.0-SNAPSHOT")
``` 

to your plugin.sbt

# How to Use

* Select your ember version in your Build.scala. Currently supported versions include 1.4.0, 1.3.0, 1.2.0, 1.1.2, 1.0.0, 1.0.0-rc.8, 1.0.0-rc.7, 1.0.0-rc.6, 1.0.0-rc.5, 1.0.0-rc.4, 1.0.0-rc.3, 1.0.0-rc.1 and 1.0.0-pre.2

```scala
  import com.ketalo.play.plugins.emberjs.EmberJsKeys
  import sbt._

  object ApplicationBuild extends Build with EmberJsKeys {

    val appName         = "play-emberjs-sample"
    val appVersion      = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

    val appDependencies = Seq.empty

    val main = play.Project(appName, appVersion, appDependencies).settings(
      emberJsVersion := "1.4.0"
    )

  }
```

* Or if you prefer using build.sbt:

```
name := "<My app name>"

version := "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  jdbc,
  anorm,
  cache
)

emberJsVersion := "1.4.0"

play.Project.playScalaSettings
```

* Include ember.js and the corresponding jQuery and handlebars files. Note that they are not provided by the sbt plugin. Check the ember site for them: [ember.js](https://ember.js) 
```html
    <script src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/jquery-1.8.2.min.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/handlebars-v1.3.0.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/ember.min.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

* Put your handlebar template (.handlebars) files under the ```app/assets/templates``` directory

* Reference the generated .js in a  ```<script>``` tag:
```html
<script src="@routes.Assets.at("templates/templates.pre.js")"></script>
```

The generated templates.pre.js has the javascript code containing all the precompiled templates in that directory

* **OR** Reference the minified .js in a  ```<script>``` tag:
```
<script src="@routes.Assets.at("templates/templates.pre.min.js")"></script>
```

# Acknowledgments

This plugin was based the work from the blog post [Ember/Handlebars template precompilation with Play](http://eng.netwallet.com/2012/04/25/emberhandlebars-template-precompilation-with-play/)

A good portion of the plugin internals were based on the [Dust.js play plugin](https://github.com/typesafehub/play-plugins/tree/master/dust)

# Modifications to ember.js

Ember.js uses modern javascript features that are not properly supported by rhino 1.7R4 which is the one used with the play framework.
This has been documented in [rhino#93](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/93) and [emberjs#1202](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/1202).
The plugin thus need a customized version of the ember-xxx.js file that can be complied by rhino.

The changes required are:

* Ember.js defines a function **ComputedPropertyPrototype.volatile**. **volatile** is a reserved keyword in rhino, so all instances are replaced by **_volatile**
* Ember.js uses sometime the name **char** as a variable name and that isn't supported in rhino either. In each case the variable is renamed to **ch**
